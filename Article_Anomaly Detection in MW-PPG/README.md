# Title: Evaluation of Embedded Machine Learning Classifiers for Anomaly Detection in Multi-wavelength Photoplethysmogram
Anomaly Detection in Multi-Wavelength Photoplethysmography using Lightweight Machine Learning Algorithms

# What ?

The main objective of this paper is to explore the potential of ML algorithms to improve
the reliability of MW-PPG acquisition systems by investigating their use in artifact detection.
An overview of several anomalies commonly associated with MW-PPG signals is provided
to accomplish this. Different methods for extracting and selecting features from MW-PPG
signals are evaluated. Furthermore, a set of relevant features that can be used along with
lightweight ML models for artifact detection are proposed.
The main contributions presented in this paper are:

• A set of features with high information gain in the classification context for anomaly
detection in MW-PPG signals is proposed.

• Evaluation of machine learning models at different window sizes for high-accurate
anomaly detection in MW-PPG.

• Examining the effectiveness of combining MW-PPG signals in detecting outliers and
filtering anomalous windows from the signal.

# Why ?

Over the past few years, there has been an increased interest in photoplethysmography
(PPG) technology, which has revealed that, in addition to heart rate and oxygen saturation, the pulse
shape of the PPG signal contains much more valuable information. Lately, the wearable market has
shifted towards a multi-wavelength and multichannel approach to increase signal robustness and
facilitate the extraction of other intrinsic information from the signal. This transition presents several
challenges related to algorithms’ complexity, accuracy, and reliability. To address these challenges,
anomaly detection stages can be employed to increase the accuracy and reliability of estimated
parameters. Powerful algorithms, such as lightweight machine learning (ML) algorithms, can be used
for anomaly detection in multi-wavelength PPG (MW-PPG).

# How ?

Different ML models are evaluated and different feature sets. There are two approaches employed: channel-level anomaly
detection and sensor-level anomaly detection.
